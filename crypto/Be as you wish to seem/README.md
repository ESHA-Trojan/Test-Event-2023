# Description
Socrates had been tasked with keeping the secret flag from you.
You knew he was not up to the challenge, as he tends to run his mouth.
During the middle of the day, you hide in the gardens, hoping he would pass by.
Suddenly, you hear Socrates boasting to his friends, about how you will never get the flag.
He had devised a brand new encryption algorithm, he called it the **one-time pad.** 

He said he tested the algorithm on one of his favourite sayings: "virtue_is_its_own_reward". 

You go back home empty-handed. Will you never find the flag? 
You start pondering the meaning of life.

But then you remember while spying on Socrates the other day, you found two ciphertexts.

He wouldn't be so lazy to use the same key **twice**...?
