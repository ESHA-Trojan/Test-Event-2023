# Description
As you were walking through the field today, a **strip of parchment paper** caught your eye.
There is some scrambled text on there, but you have honestly no clue what it's supposed to mean.
You take it to the village intellectual, who tells you this is some sort of encryption used by the Greeks. 
Unfortunately, he had no idea how to decrypt it.
This note might contain some very useful information about the military campaigns.
